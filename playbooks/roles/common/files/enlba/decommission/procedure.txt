Objective: To decommission as103.enlba



1. Notify Service Ops and NRT that decommission is taking place:

Service.Ops@bskyb.com
NetworkRepairTeam-IP@bskyb.com

2. From the jumphost run the following commands:

    scp -r as103:IMAGES/6.0R5 ./
    touch factory_default.cfg
    touch factory_default.ndx
    touch bof.cfg

# ensure to have the above files and directories inside its own directory in your jumphost.

3. edit bof.cfg and add the following contents:

	    primary-image    cf1:\images\6.0R5\
	    primary-config   cf1:\factory_default.cfg

	#eth-mgmt Port Settings:
	    no  eth-mgmt-disabled
	    eth-mgmt-autoneg
	    eth-mgmt-duplex    full
	    eth-mgmt-speed     100

	#System Settings:
	    wait               3
	    persist            on
	    console-speed      115200
	    no  console-disabled

4. Set as103.enlba to 'decommissioned' on devicedb.

5. Monitor traffic on as103.enlba towards ar10.enlba.

as103.enlba (Console)
=====================

monitor lag 30 rate interval 3

There should be little if any traffic on uplink LAG.

6. Apply configuration contained in the file below for ar10.enlba.

"ar10.enlba.txt"


Ensure all syntax applies successfully.

7. Login to as103.enlba via console and erase files/bof in the flash directory of as103.enlba, then create an empty config file.

file delete *.cfg force
file delete *.txt force
file delete CFG/* force

8. issue the following commands and record its output in a text file to send to networkservicessupport@bksykb.com:

show chassis
show card detail

9. from the jumphost transfer the contents created at 1. and 2.:

        scp -r * as103.enlba:

After this has been completed, there should be no configuration on any upstream devices, the device is "decommissioned" in devicedb and the switch will be blank on reload

10. Advise the FE that the switch can be unpatched/removed from the rack and returned to Unipart


11. Email networkservicessupport@bksykb.com to advise that the switch is decommissioned - the DNS removal will then be raised by the IP NetDev Engineer
