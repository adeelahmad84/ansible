SUMMARY

This change is to commission an aggregation switch connecting to ar20.enbrs.  This is to accomodate the 1Gig-e servers that cannot be attached directly to ar20.enbrs.  This change not going ahead will impact the services running across the 1G servers.

ROLLBACK
#########

As this change is to provide connectivity to the new as101.enbrs & as102.enbrs which has no servers attached to them,
 we do not anticipate any impact to existing services.  But if you feel you need to rool back then please shut the ports 
 on interface range te2/5 - 8.
