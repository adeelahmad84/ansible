C2: Card commissioning on CDN PE [HOBIR][AR11-CDN.HOBIR]


Business Justification:

This change is to add a new line card into ar11-cdn.hobir.
This is to accomodate the accelerated growth of CDN capacity.
The change being on hold will impact the capacity SNS can provide for CDN services.




Implementation Steps:

Tech Summary
*******************
The implementation steps should take approxiately 20 minutes to complete.

This change is to:
- Configure a new line card in ar11-cdn.hobir.

1. After running the pre-checks please instruct the FE to install the line card into slot 6.
2. Please apply the commands found in the file named ar11-cdn.hobir.txt
3. Move onto post-checks found in Test Plan



Test Plan:

Pre-Checks
***************
1. Please verify with the FE that you both have the slot information.  The slot in question is 6.

2. Please run the commands found in the file named ar11-cdn.hobir_prepost.txt
- expect to see no card provisioned on slot 6:

	MINOR: CLI No card in slot "6".
	MINOR: CLI No Matching Entries.

N.B. If you do see a card already installed in slot 6 which has live ports then please backout the change.

Post-Checks
***************
Please run the commands found in the file named ar11-cdn.hobir_prepost.txt

- expect to see the card provisioned, ports visible from card 6.

Backout Plan:

If the change causes an impact on existing services or the expected results are not produced then please proceed with running the commands found in ar11-cdn.hobir_rollback.txt.
Please instuct the FE to leave the card in its place as the card will be shut down.  The next working day this can be further investigated.
Please re-run the commands found in the file named ar11-cdn.hobir_prepost.txt and ensure the card in slot 6 is administratively down.





Risk Assessment

This is a new card commissioning procedure which is BAU.  Therefore no impact on existing services anticipated.
If change went wrong such as trying to provision a card on a slot which has live services, then the risks are that services residing the line card in question will have disruption.
The pre-checks will ensure that the slot 6 will have no pre-existing provisioning therefore mitigating this risk.
