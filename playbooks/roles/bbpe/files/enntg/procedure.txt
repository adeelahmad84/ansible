This work is to bring into service the Alcatel 7750 sr12.enntg. This procedure will establish a DRFU status
for this device on successful completeion. Steps have been taken to ensure that this process progresses
without out any anomalies. In the event of any issues. Please do refer to the roll back plan for next action.

Essentially it involves : Establishing ISIS, BGP peering with the P routers, Route Reflectors & Ironman Platform.

Implementation:
=========================
Please apply the configuration of the respected devices in the following order:

   ar0-isp.bllon.txt
   ar0.enlba.txt
   ar0-isp.enbgk.txt
   ar0-isp.enlba.txt
   ar0-isp.enshf.txt
   ar0-isp.hobir.txt
   ar4.bllon.txt
   ar13.thlon.txt
   ar13.enlba.txt
   br0.hobir.txt
   br0.enlba.txt
   br0.bllon.txt
   br0.thlon.txt
   pr2.enlba.txt
   pr3.thlon.txt
   rr0.bllon.txt
   rr0.enlba.txt

   rr3.bllon.txt
   rr3.enlba.txt

Test Plan:
===========
1.0
Pre-checks (Take appropriate records of these outputs as they will be handy in a rollback situation):-


Before proceeding with the migration ensure that the following prechecks have been adhered to
	-	Check monitoring systems to ensure that there are no unreported errors.
	-   	Speak to the transmission team to confirm that there are no known outages.

- please run the following commands on rr*, ar0-isp.*

sh ip bgp neighbors 84.38.34.170

- please run the following commands on br0.*:

show service id 400010 base

- please run the following commands on the ncs:

- post checks:

Check RX light levels at both ends of the circuits. Level should be comparable to existing
uplinks.

pr2.enlba Te0/7/0/8/2:
sh controllers Te0/7/0/8/2 phy | i pow
pr2.enlba Te0/7/0/8/1:
sh controllers Te0/7/0/8/1 phy | i pow
pr2.enlba Te0/7/0/8/0:
sh controllers Te0/7/0/8/0 phy | i pow

pr3.thlon Te0/1/0/9/9:
sh controllers Te0/1/0/9/9 phy | i pow
pr3.thlon Te0/1/0/9/8:
sh controllers Te0/1/0/9/8 phy | i pow
pr3.thlon Te0/1/0/9/7:
sh controllers Te0/1/0/9/7 phy | i pow

Ensure that the Tx Output Power (dBm) ,Rx Optical Power (avg dBm) values. These
should be comparable to the sample in the first column shown below.

Note, this check should not stop this work, however any abnormal values should be
reported for investigation.

Backout Plan:
=============
In case the implementation was to impact any existing services.

For NCS if your commit(s) was/were the last ones use the "rollback configuration <last|to>" command.

If there have been subsequent commits you do not wish to rollback:

Identify your commit ID using the command
    show config commit list

Use the command
     show configuration rollback changes <n>
to identify the necessary configuration needed to rollback for the commit.

The above are the preferable ways to rollback as they are less prone to error.

Manual backout documented in below files.

Risk Assessment:
==================
No services are anticipated to be impacted as they no service traffic will be carried.  New device is being introduced with no traffic on it.

If the change went wrong, for example applying the wrong peer address in the route-reflector knocks off an existing BGP session causing for the impacted PE to be less resilient.  However there will be no outage as the PE will have a neighbor established with the other route-reflector.
