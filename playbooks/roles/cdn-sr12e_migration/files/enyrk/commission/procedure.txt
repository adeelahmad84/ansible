Business Justification:
=========================
As part of the CDN Growth project, all PEs in the core and satelitte POPs will a have a hardware upgrade to SR12e.  This is so that the CDN network can accomodate the growing capacity of server farms housed in SNS.
This is the commissioning of ar11-cdn.enyrk in readiness of its DRFU.
If this was not go ahead then it will impact the capacity handling of the CDN traffic for this site.


Implementation:
=========================
Please apply the configuration of the respected devices in the following order:

    pr2.enlba
    pr2.hobir
    rr0.bllon
    rr1.bllon
    rr3.bllon
    rr0.enlba
    rr1.enlba
    rr3.enlba

Test Plan:
===========
Depending on the comissioning of ar11-cdn.enyrk BGP/ISIS sessions may or not come up.  ar11-cdn.enyrk will be attached for you to double check addressing/authentication/etc.

Backout Plan:
=============
In case the implementation was to impact any existing services.  Please apply the config in the following:


    pr2.enlba-rollback.txt
    pr2.hobir-rollback.txt
    rr0.bllon-rollback.txt
    rr1.bllon-rollback.txt
    rr3.bllon-rollback.txt
    rr0.enlba-rollback.txt
    rr1.enlba-rollback.txt
    rr3.enlba-rollback.txt


Risk Assessment:
==================
No services are anticipated to be impacted as they no service traffic will be carried.  New device is being introduced with no traffic on it.

If the change went wrong, for example applying the wrong peer address in the route-reflector knocks off an existing BGP session causing for the impacted PE to be less resilient.  However there will be no outage as the PE will have a neighbor established with the other route-reflector.
