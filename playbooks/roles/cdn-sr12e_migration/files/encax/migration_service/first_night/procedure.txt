Summary:

This change is to migrate Netflix and MCDN-1 services in encax to an sr12e device.  This is to accomodate the accelerated CDN Growth.

Implementation:

1. Please run the pre-checks on ar10.encax using ar10.encax_service_migration_pre.txt, record the output for comparison later.
2. Please use ar10.encax_service_shut.txt to shut ports/services down on ar10.encax
3. Please instruct the FE to carry out the physical migration.
4. Please use ar11-cdn.encax_service_new.txt to configure and migrate services across to ar11-cdn.encax
5. After the FE has completed please run ar11-cdn.encax_service_migration_post.txt to run post-checks.  Record the output and run a diff with the pre-checks.
With the exception of the ports id, the rest of the results should be identical.  This should be easy to spot when running something 'vimdiff'.

6. If for some reason one of the services wasn't successful and see a significant difference between pre and post-check, please proceed in rolling back ONLY FOR THAT SERVICES.  Do not rollback everything unless the full migration is unsuccessful.

    N.B. when you run a diff between the two pre and post check outputs, expect to see ARP/MAC-ADDRESS table (if applicable) and the number of prefixes being advertised to be the same.

- Attached are rollback files named as below:

    ar10.encax_rollback.txt
    ar11-cdn.encax_services_rollback.txt
