1. Login into ar10.thlon using the following command:

cms ar10.thlon


2. Rename the bof: 'file move bof.cfg bof.cfg.bak'

3. Reboot ar10.thlon using 'admin reboot'

    a. The 7750 will produce an error stating that it's unable to find a bof.
    b. The device will prompt you to state the path of the image, type in:

	- 'cf3:\IMAGES\TiMOS-10.0.R5\'

    c. It will ask you for primary config url, please press ENTER to keep it blank, then save the bof and it will boot a blank configuration.

4. Login using the default username and password:

    Login: admin
    Password: admin

5. You will know its default as the device serial number will be shown at the prompt, configure the primary-config path in the bof.

    - 'bof primary-config cf3:\config.cfg'

6. Save the blank config: 'admin save'

7. The quickest and cleanest way to reset the flash drives is shut, format and then unshut the standby CPM.

    - file shutdown cf3-B:
    - file format cf3-B:
    - file no shutdown cf3-B:
    - admin redundancy synchronise boot-env

8. Switchover to CPM-B using 'admin redundancy force-switchover now'

    N.B. You will need to console into the secondary console port to access CPM-B.

9. Once logged into CPM-B using the default credentials repeat step 7 but for cf3-A instead.

10. Finally run the below commands and reboot.

    - show chassis
    - show card detail
