Summary:

C2: CDN PE Decommission [AR10.THLON]




Business Justification:

This is to decommission a PE which has had all services migrated away from it.
As per the design requirement the PE now redundant in the network.
If this change doesn;t take place then this will impact the delivery of other services which will require the hardware.


Implementation Steps:

Tech Summary
=============

This change is to decommission a PE, this involves the following:

    - Removing BGP sessions from the route-reflectors.
    - Defaulting the relevant configuration in the remote devices (i.e. NCS).
    - Resetting the PE to factory default.

After completing the pre-checks found in 'Test Plan' please carry out the following:

1. Please log into devicedb and set ar10.thlon to 'decommissioned'.

2. Please follow the steps in the files attached (listed below):

    - route-reflectors.txt
    - NCS.txt (apply config on pr2.thlon and pr3.thlon)
    - ar14-cdn.thlon.txt
    - ar10.thlon.txt

3. Please proceed to the post-checks found in 'Test Plan'


Test Plan:

**PRE-CHECK**
1. Please run the following commands to ensure that IP loopback belongs to the correct hostname:

    host ar10.thlon
    host 84.38.34.78
    findip2 84.38.34.78

2. Please retrieve backup config of ar10.thlon from devicedb.

3. Please ensure that no active incidents are in place relating to ar14-cdn.thlon, ar10.thlon, pr2.thlon and pr3.thlon.  If so please put this change on hold.

4. Check the weathermaps to ensure that there are no significant traffic running across the uplinks: http://stats0.bllon.isp.sky.com/weathermaps/cdn-core.html

	a. If so then please put the change on hold and email the change owner to investigate.

5. Please log into https://insightandplanning.sns.sky.com/apps#/ut/cdn/cells and verify that the links to take down in ar14-cdn.thlon are listed in TG2458.

6. Notify Service Ops and NRT that decommission is taking place:

    - Service.Ops@bskyb.com
    - NetworkRepairTeam-IP@bskyb.com


**POST-CHECK**
After completing the 'Implementation Plan' please carry out the following:

1. Check to see no incidents/alerts have been raised in relation to this change.

2. Email DCNrequests@bskyb.com (copying in the change owner) notifying that them that ar10.thlon is now decommissioned and they can reclaim the following:

    - 10.200.194.67
    - 10.200.194.68
    - Console: 10.200.194.31 ports 18 and 19

3. Email the output of 'show chassis' and 'show card detail' command to NetworkServicesSupport@bskyb.com for parts tracking.

4. Email the change owner with the following instructions to action:

'''
ar10.thlon has been successfully decommissioned, please return the following addresses back to its pool:

    - 84.38.34.78 (Ensure the DNS records are removed)
    - 89.200.131.144/31
'''

Backout Plan:

If there are incidents raised and live services have been found to be impacted due to this change then please find the files attached named as the following to rollback:

    - rr_rollback.txt

**FOR NCS DEVICES ONLY**
If your commit(s) was/were the last ones use the "rollback configuration <last|to>" command.

If there have been subsequent commits you do not wish to rollback:

Identify your commit ID using the command
    show config commit list

Use the command
     show configuration rollback changes <n>
to identify the necessary configuration needed to rollback for the commit.

The above are the preferable ways to rollback as they are less prone to error.


Risk Assessment:

All services have been decommissioned/migrated away from thie PE, therefore no live services are anticipated to be impacted.
If change was to go wrong such as removing the wrong loopback address then the impact will be that a PE possibly using the wrong address will be suffering a full outage.
The chances of this is remote as the pre-checks will have identified the loopback address belonging to the correct PE.
