Check the existing module is working:

rs0-cdn.thlon
=============

show inventory
show platform
show facility-alarm status
show interface description


If everything is OK, ask the FE to continue below:

1. Remove the blanking plate from the expansion slot
2. Insert the SPA into the slot

Check the new module has initialised correctly.


RS0-CDN.ENLBA
=============

1.  Check the status LED of the new SPA (daughtercard)

This should be solid green, after amber for a few seconds.


2.  Check the status LED of the SIP (fathercard)

This should be solid green

3. Enter command 'show inventory'

Expect to see (serial number will be different):

NAME: "SPA subslot 0/1", DESCR: "1-port 10 Gigabit Ethernet Shared Port Adapter XFP based"
PID: SPA-1X10GE-L-V2   , VID: V01, SN: JAB105005QJ

NAME: "subslot 0/1 transceiver 0", DESCR: "OC192 + 10GBASE-L"
PID: XFP10GLR-192SR-L    , VID: 00 , SN: ONT163200S9

4. Enter command 'show platform'

This should show exact as prechecks, with the below addition:

Slot      Type                State                 Insert time (ago)
--------- ------------------- --------------------- -----------------
 0/1      SPA-1X10GE-L-V2     ok                    1d


5. Enter command "show facility-alarm status"

This should be exactly the same as prechecks, with no new errors


6.  Enter command 'show int desc'

expect to see:

Interface                      Status         Protocol Description
Te0/1/0                        up             up

7.  Enter command 'show log'

Check to ensure there are no errors/warnings relating to the SPA install, and the successful messages are shown:

%SPA_OIR-6-ONLINECARD: SPA (SPA-1X10GE-L-V2) online in subslot 0/1
%IOSXE_SPA-6-UPDOWN: Interface TenGigabitEthernet0/1/0, link down due to local fault
%LINK-3-UPDOWN: SIP0/1: Interface EOBC0/1, changed state to up
