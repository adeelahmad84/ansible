This change is to accomodate the commission/expansion for {{ site_id }}.

n.b. this change is going ahead of the server plug ups therefore ports will be operationally down.

Please apply the following steps:

1. Run the prechecks specified in {{ hostname }}_ntf_prepost.txt and  bbpe_ntf_prepost.txt

Note: Please save the output for comparison later.

3. Please apply the implementation commands in the following attached files:
{{ hostname }}_ntf.txt
{% for key, value in bbpe|dictsort %}
{{ value.hostname }}_ntf_prefix_add.txt
{% endfor %}


4. Run the postchecks specified in {{ hostname }}_ntf_prepost.txt and bbpe_ntf_prepost

    Run a diff between the two, you should see new services, ports, prefixes although they will be down.

5. If for any reason the implementation has impacted any live services please proceed to rollback using {{ hostname }}_ntf_rollback.txt and bbpe_ntf_rollback.


N.B. AS THIS IS A NEW SERVICE TO BE DEPLOYED, IF POST-CHECKS ARE NOT WHAT YOU EXPECT; AS LONG AS NO LIVE SERVICES ARE IMPACTED PLEASE DO NOT ROLLBACK THE DEPLOYMENT.  ALL PORTS/INTERFACES HAVE BEEN SET UP WITH 'NO-MON', PLEASE DOUBLE CHECK BEFORE CLOSING OFF THE CHANGE.
