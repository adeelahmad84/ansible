This change is to accomodate the commission/expansion for {{ site_id }}.

n.b. this change is going ahead of the server plug ups therefore ports will be operationally down.

Please apply the following steps:

1. Run the prechecks specified in:

{{ hostname }}_prepost.txt
bbpe_prepost.txt
{% include 'prepost_bbpe1_4500.j2' %}

Note: Please save the output for comparison later.

2. Please apply the implementation commands in the following attached files:

{{ hostname }}.txt
{% for key, value in bbpe|dictsort %}
{{ value.hostname }}_lag_upgrade.txt
{% endfor %}

Please note: On the BBPE the 'port-threshold' needs to change.  You will need to look at the total number of ports in a given lag after the above lag-upgrade implementation and calculate 'two-thirds of total, then minus 1'.

after calculating please add the following configuration:

***************
exit all
configure
    lag 50
	port-threshold $CALCULATED_NUMBER action down
    exit all
***************

3. Run the postchecks specified in {{ hostname }}_prepost.txt and bbpe_prepost and bbpe_lag_upgrade_prepost.txt

    Run a diff between the two, you should see new services, ports, prefixes although they will be down.

4. If for any reason the implementation has impacted any live services please proceed to rollback using:

{{ hostname }}_rollback.txt
bbpe_rollback.txt
{% for key, value in bbpe|dictsort %}
{{ value.hostname }}_lag_upgrade_rollback.txt
{% endfor %}


N.B. AS THIS IS A NEW SERVICE TO BE DEPLOYED, IF POST-CHECKS ARE NOT WHAT YOU EXPECT; AS LONG AS NO LIVE SERVICES ARE IMPACTED PLEASE DO NOT ROLLBACK THE DEPLOYMENT.  ALL PORTS/INTERFACES HAVE BEEN SET UP WITH 'NO-MON', PLEASE DOUBLE CHECK BEFORE CLOSING OFF THE CHANGE.
