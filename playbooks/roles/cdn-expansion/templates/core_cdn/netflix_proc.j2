This change to accomodate the netflix commission/expansion for {{ site_id }}.

n.b. this change is going ahead of the server plug ups therefore ports will be operationally down.

Please apply the following steps:

1. Run the prechecks specified in {{ hostname }}_netflix_prepost.txt

Note: Please save the output for comparison later.

2. Please apply the implementation commands in {{ hostname }}_netflix.txt

3. Run the postchecks specified in {{ hostname }}_netflix_prepost.txt

    Run a diff between the two, you should see new services, ports, prefixes although they will be down.

4. if for any reason the implementation has impacted any live services please proceed to rollback using {{ hostname }}_netflix_rollback.txt

N.B. AS THIS IS A NEW SERVICE TO BE DEPLOYED, IF POST-CHECKS ARE NOT WHAT YOU EXPECT; AS LONG AS NO LIVE SERVICES ARE IMPACTED PLEASE DO NOT ROLLBACK THE DEPLOYMENT.  ALL PORTS/INTERFACES HAVE BEEN SET UP WITH 'NO-MON', PLEASE DOUBLE CHECK BEFORE CLOSING OFF THE CHANGE.
