This change is to accomodate the commission/expansion for enwkg.

n.b. this change is going ahead of the server plug ups therefore ports will be operationally down.

Please apply the following steps:

1. Run the prechecks specified in:

ar20.enwkg_ggc_prepost.txt
bbpe_ggc_prepost.txt
sr10.enwkg_lag_upgrade_prepost.txt
sr11.enwkg_lag_upgrade_prepost.txt

Note: Please save the output for comparison later.

2. Please apply the implementation commands in the following attached files:

ar20.enwkg_ggc.txt
sr10.enwkg_ggc_prefix_add.txt
sr10.enwkg_lag_upgrade.txt
sr11.enwkg_ggc_prefix_add.txt
sr11.enwkg_lag_upgrade.txt

Please note: On the BBPE the 'port-threshold' needs to change.  You will need to look at the total number of ports in a given lag after the above lag-upgrade implementation and calculate 'two-thirds of total, then minus 1'.

after calculating please add the following configuration:

***************
exit all
configure
    lag 50
	port-threshold $CALCULATED_NUMBER action down
    exit all
***************

3. Run the postchecks specified in ar20.enwkg_ggc_prepost.txt and bbpe_ggc_prepost and bbpe_lag_upgrade_prepost.txt

    Run a diff between the two, you should see new services, ports, prefixes although they will be down.

4. If for any reason the implementation has impacted any live services please proceed to rollback using:

ar20.enwkg_ggc_rollback.txt 
bbpe_ggc_rollback.txt
sr10.enwkg_lag_upgrade_rollback.txt
sr11.enwkg_lag_upgrade_rollback.txt


N.B. AS THIS IS A NEW SERVICE TO BE DEPLOYED, IF POST-CHECKS ARE NOT WHAT YOU EXPECT; AS LONG AS NO LIVE SERVICES ARE IMPACTED PLEASE DO NOT ROLLBACK THE DEPLOYMENT.  ALL PORTS/INTERFACES HAVE BEEN SET UP WITH 'NO-MON', PLEASE DOUBLE CHECK BEFORE CLOSING OFF THE CHANGE.
