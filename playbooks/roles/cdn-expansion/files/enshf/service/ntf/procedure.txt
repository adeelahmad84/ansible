This change is to accomodate the commission/expansion for enshf.

n.b. this change is going ahead of the server plug ups therefore ports will be operationally down.

Please apply the following steps:

1. Run the prechecks specified in ar20.enshf_ntf_prepost.txt and  bbpe_ntf_prepost.txt

Note: Please save the output for comparison later.

3. Please apply the implementation commands in the following attached files:
ar20.enshf_ntf.txt
sr10.enshf_ntf_prefix_add.txt
sr11.enshf_ntf_prefix_add.txt
sr12.enshf_ntf_prefix_add.txt


4. Run the postchecks specified in ar20.enshf_ntf_prepost.txt and bbpe_ntf_prepost

    Run a diff between the two, you should see new services, ports, prefixes although they will be down.

5. If for any reason the implementation has impacted any live services please proceed to rollback using ar20.enshf_ntf_rollback.txt and bbpe_ntf_rollback.


N.B. AS THIS IS A NEW SERVICE TO BE DEPLOYED, IF POST-CHECKS ARE NOT WHAT YOU EXPECT; AS LONG AS NO LIVE SERVICES ARE IMPACTED PLEASE DO NOT ROLLBACK THE DEPLOYMENT.  ALL PORTS/INTERFACES HAVE BEEN SET UP WITH 'NO-MON', PLEASE DOUBLE CHECK BEFORE CLOSING OFF THE CHANGE.
