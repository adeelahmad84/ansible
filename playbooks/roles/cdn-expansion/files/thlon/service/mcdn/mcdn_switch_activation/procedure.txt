C2: MCDN Region - Management Enablement [TG2578]

Business Justification:

This change is to allow MCDN to gain management to their switch.
This change will then allow MCDN to provision their region.
This change not going ahead will impact the delivery of the region commissioning for MCDN.







Implementation Steps:

Tech Summary
*******************
The implementation steps should take approxiately 20 minutes to complete.

This change is to:
- Take a single port out of the existing LAG.
- Replace the LAG bound to the existing IES interface with the single port taken out of the existing LAG.

1. After running the pre-checks please apply the commands found in the file named ar14-cdn.thlon.txt
2. Move onto post-checks found in Test Plan








Test Plan:

Pre-Checks
***************
1. Please go to the URL: https://insightandplanning.sns.sky.com/apps#/ut/cdn/cells and ensure that the single port referenced in the change, is associated to reference TG2578.

4. Please run the commands found in the file named ar14-cdn.thlon_prepost.txt (expected results are also in the file).

Post-Checks
***************
Please run the commands found in the file named ar14-cdn.thlon_prepost.txt (expected results are also in the file)





Backout Plan:

If the post-check ouputs do not satisfy your expectation then please follow this action in the below situations:

- if ports are up = Shut them down
- LAG/Service-id isn't configured or not admin up = please reconfigure and ensure they are not shut down.
- if prefixes are not visible in the prefix-list = please add the prefixes to the prefix-list.

If the implementation was to impact any live services then proceed to back out with the file named ar14-cdn.thlon_rollback.txt.
Upon completing rollback please re run the commands found in the file named ar14-cdn.thlon_prepost.txt  AND compare the results with the output of the precheck = ensure they are identical.






Risk Assessment:

This is a network configuration to be in place prior to introducing the new MCDN region.  No live services are anticipated to be impacted.
If the change went wrong such as configuring the a duplicate IP address then any services with the same IP could be at risk.
The chances are slim as a pre-check will be done using the findip2 tool to determine whether the IP range exists.
